Below is a smattering of gdb hints, tips, and tricks. Some might even be useful
during this course.  If you'd like to contribute to this cheatsheet, let me know!

 - To switch to intel syntax: `set disassembly-flavor intel`
 - Use `set {int}0x8049700=0xdeadbeef` to write the value 0xdeadbeef to address 0x8049700.
 - Remember you can use `int3` in your shellcode (op code `0xcc`) to cause a breakpoint.


**Running the binary:**
 - Reload the binary: `file foo`, useful if you pop a shell with `execv` from inside
of gdb.
 - Run the current program with input from a file: `r < input.in`
 - Run the current program with command line args: `r foo bar`
 - Or run with arbitrary arguments: `r "`/bin/echo -ne "echo this string \x41"`" "bar"`


**Working with breakpoints:**
 - Setting by function name: `break *main`
 - By offset in function: `b *main+10`
 - By address: `break *0x400D02`
 - `si` will step instruction by instruction going into function calls whereas
 - `ni` will step over function calls.
 - Be careful though, `si` and `ni` seem to skip over `int3` instructions.

**Working with registers:**
 - Getting values: `info registers`
 - Setting values: `set $eax=0`

**Getting infromation:**
 - `info functions`
 - `disassemble main`
 - `disass main`
 - This command will disassemble the function that contains the instruction at
   address 0x08... `disassemble 0x08...`
 - Print out the string representation of the bytes at a given address: `x/s 0x4005d0` 
 - Print out a word of memory relative to the stack pointer: `x/wx $esp+0x5c` 
 - `x foo` will give you the location of function `foo`.
 - `p system` will give you the address of the libc function `system`.
 - View the mapped address space: `info proc mappings`
 - Use `backtrace` to find out where you where in a program when it crashed, e.g.,
after a segmentation fault. Caveat, if your bug smashes the stack then the
backtrace won't be able to make much sense of where you are.


**Pagination:**
 - `set pagination on`
 - `set pagination off`
 - `show pagination`



#### Creating Hooks 

Create a hook to print some information on every break point:

```
define hook-stop
info registers
x/24wx $esp
x/2i $eip
end
```
This hook will print all of the register values, the stack, and the next two
instructions.


#### Viewing struct values nicely:

```
set $foo = (struct bar *) 0x804a008

#get the address
print $foo

#get a value of the struct's members
print *$foo

#get the value of an attribute
print $foo->name

#examine the memory at the address stored in the attribute
x $foo->name
```
