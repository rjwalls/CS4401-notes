One of the most commonly deployed defenses is **address space layout
randomization (ASLR)**. As the name suggests, ASLR randomizes the address space
layout to make it difficult for attackers to find gadgets, the address of libc
functions, the objects on the stack, and the objects in the heap. Intuitively,
if the attacker does not know these addresses then constructing a working
exploit becomes significantly more difficult.

While there are many different proposed and implemented variations of ASLR, this
post will focus on the [version proposed by the PAX
team](https://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt) and implemented in Linux 32-bit
and 64-bit systems.

### The Basics for 32-bit x86

In 32-bit Linux, ASLR randomizes the starting locating for three areas of memory:

- the **executable area** which contains the code, initialized data, and
  uninitialized data,
- the **mapped area** which contains dynamically linked libraries, the heap,
  and thread stacks,
- and the **stack area** which contains the main user stack.

The starting location for each area, also called the base offset, is selected
randomly for each area at process start. In other words, each region will be
given a different base offset for each execution of the program.

There are restrictions for what those random offsets can be. Take the mapped
area for example, while the base address is a 32-bit number, ASLR will only
randomize bits 12-27. ASLR won't randomize bits 0-11 because it would break
page alignment and it won't randomize bits 28-31 because that would make it
harder to allocate big pages [(Ref. 1)][aslr-problems]. As a result of these
restrictions, there are only 2^16 possible starting offsets for the mapped
area. In other words, ASLR provides 16 bits of randomness for the mapped area.
The stack and executable areas have similar restrictions and ASLR provides 24
and 16 bits of randomness for those areas, respectively.

Now lets take a quick glance at what ASLR actually looks like from the
perspective of a user on a 64-bit system. First, let's turn it on (though it is
probably enabled by default). To turn ASLR on in Ubuntu run `echo 2 | sudo tee
/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` and if you want to turn it off run `echo 0
| sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`. Now consider this simple C
program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argv, char **argc){
    int target = 42;
    printf("The address of target: %p\n", &target);
    return 0;
}
```

If we run the program a few times, we should see something similar to the
following:

```
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffde80b5e14
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7fff2bff9bb4
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffeae3f9a54
$ ./aslr
The address of target: 0x7ffec254dde4
```

From the output, we can see that the address of target is different for every
execution. The first 3 bits and the last 4 bits appear to be constant but the
remaining bits change for every execution. This is ASLR's doing. The `target`
variable is placed on the stack and every time we a start new process the stack
is moved.

Lets also look where libc (we're calling printf from this library) is located
with every new process. After running `ldd aslr` a few times we see the
following:

```
$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcaa9f6000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f3a5829c000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f3a58666000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffc7953c000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f58e459f000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f58e4969000)

$ ldd aslr
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffdaccb0000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fd94bf69000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fd94c333000)
```

By comparing the addresses given in this output, we can conclude that the
leading bits and the last 12 bits stay the same while the remaining bits are
randomized.

### Defeating Coarse-Grained ASLR

The ASLR scheme we've described above is also called **coarse-grained ALSR**.
The term "coarse-grained" here refers to the fact that this variety of ASLR
does not randomize _within_ each area. For example, while the starting offset
of libc is placed in a random location on each run, libc itself is not changed.
Think of coarse-grained ASLR as the rough equivalent of placing a book at a
random location on a bookshelf; the book itself moves around, but the order and
number of pages in that book stay the same.

What does this coarse-grained property mean for security? To answer this
question, let's consider a simple return-to-libc attack that exploits a buffer
overflow. To execute this attack, the attacker needs to know the address of
`system` (which is in the mapped area) and the address of the attacker-supplied
string to pass to system (which is on the stack). In a perfect world, this
means the attacker has to deal with 16+24 bits of randomness (on a 32-bit
system), i.e., it is extremely unlikely that the attacker will correctly guess
the address of system and the address of the argument string in the randomized
address space layout. Further, the attacker has to get it right on the first
try, otherwise the process will crash and the new process will have a
completely different random layout. However, as Shacham et al. point out in
their seminal work, ["On the effectiveness of address-space
randomization,"][aslr-problems] ASLR has a few problems in practice.

The first problem is the one we mentioned above: ASLR does not randomize within
each area. This decision is great for performance and simplicity of
implementation, but once the attacker can determine one known address in the
area they effectively know all other addresses in that area. For example, the
functions `usleep` and `system` are always the same distance apart for the same
version of libc. So if the attacker figures out the address of `usleep`, they
now know the address of `system` as well. This lack of internal randomization
is also a problem on the stack and the heap for similar reasons.

So how does the attacker figure out one of these addresses? One way is through
a memory leak. For example, an attacker can use a format string vulnerability
to print out the contents of the stack. Leaking memory on the stack is useful
because the stack contains pointers into executable code (e.g.,
saved return addresses) and the stack area (e.g., saved frame pointers).

Another technique to defeat ASLR on 32-bit systems is for the attacker to
simply guess addresses until she guesses correctly. This style of attack is
typically referred to as _brute-forcing_. Given that ASLR provides only 16 bits
of randomness, the attacker has a 1 in 2^16 change of guessing the correct
address for the libc function `system`. It seems like 1 in 2^16 is incredibly
bad odds for the attacker, but brute-forcing is actually practical in many
deployed system.

To understand why brute-forcing works against ASLR on 32-bit systems, we have
to discuss the next major problem with ASLR. The second problem is that ASLR
randomizes at process start but **ALSR does not re-randomize on a process
fork**. In other words, the forked process (and process threads) will have the
exact same layout as the parent process. For example, web servers are
especially at risk due to this ASLR weakness as many use process forking (and
threading) to handle requests. Shacham et al. describe how this forking
behavior leads to an attacker being able to exploit a webserver by guessing the
locations needed for a return-to-libc attack---the whole attack only requires a
few minutes of guessing to succeed. In short, every web request becomes an
opportunity for the attacker to guess the correct location of `system` as a
crash of one child process won't impact the parent process. That is, . While
there are 2^16=65,536 possible locations for `system`, with forking `system`
stays at the same location for every guess, and the attacker guess all possible
locations.

[aslr-problems]: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1030083.1030124

Fortunately, the brute-forcing attack described above becomes impractical on
64-bit systems given the much (much much) larger address space. However, 64-bit
ASLR can still be defeated by memory leaks.

Finally, ASLR works best on binaries that are compiled to be position
independent (i.e., position independence executables or PIE). _Without PIE
support, then ALSR can only randomize some parts of the address space._ For
example, the locations of the stack, heap, and libc can be randomized; but the
code section and procedure linkage table must stay at a fixed location.

### Working Directory Considerations

When exploiting programs with ASLR enabled, the working directory from which you execute your exploit can affect stack addresses. Running the same program from different directories may result in different stack layouts due to how environment variables and command-line arguments are stored. This is particularly relevant for challenges like stack2r-64 where you need consistent memory addresses. To maintain consistency between debugging and exploitation, always run your exploits from the same directory as the target binary, or use techniques like GDB attach to debug the process in its intended execution environment.

### Hint: Use PwnTools

You might wonder what's the point of an information leak if your exploit is
statically crafted and all of those addresses you leak will change once
execution ends. There exist tools, like pwntools, that allow you to start a
new process, read output from the program, and programmatically craft your
exploit string for the process based on the output obtained. If you want to
learn more, read the post on pwntools.

### Summary

With ASLR enabled, code reuse attacks become more difficult to execute because
the location of the code changes unpredictably between every execution of the
process. For instance, an attacker cannot construct a ROP chain if she doesn't
know the addresses of the gadgets used in the chain.

There are two common to bypass coarse-grained ASLR:

- _Brute forcing_ is often practical due to a lack of entropy in 32-bit address spaces.
- _Information leaks_ can directly tell an attacker the important addresses.

Finally, it is important to realize that ASLR does not remove the initial
memory error used to hi-jack control flow (e.g., a stack buffer overflow), it
just makes that bug harder to exploit.
