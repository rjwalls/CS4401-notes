As the text region of memory is typically read-only, an attacker can't modify
the existing code for a process. However, in some circumstances, it might be
possible for the attacker to supply code. This class of attack is called **code
injection**. When the injected code launches a shell, giving the attacker a
convenient interface to the hacked machine, that injected code is called
**shellcode**.

The article "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit" describes how to write and
inject shellcode into a 32-bit x86 process by exploiting a buffer overflow on
the stack. This set of notes attempts to summarize the article's shellcoding
sections and, perhaps, clarify a few points.

Writing shell code can be tricky for beginners because it requires knowledge of
assembly, C calling conventions, and the calling convention for system calls.
**For the purposes of this course, it is probably best to find shellcode online
rather than write your own.**

### Writing Shellcode

"Smashing the Stack" took a simple, but effective, approach to writing basic
shellcode. First, write a simple C program that launches a shell using the
`execve` system call. Second, disassemble that program to see how the desired
behavior was implemented using machine instructions. Third, extract, combine,
and modify those instructions to form the shellcode string. This string is
then injected into a vulnerable program.

#### The `execve` system call

Think of a system call as a means for a user-mode process to give control to
the OS kernel to carry-out a privileged task on the process's behalf. See
your favorite OS textbook for more information.

When writing shellcode, we want to use a system call to launch a shell process
that we can then interact with. In particular, `execve` is a useful system
call. If `execve` succeeds, it will transform the current process into
something new. That "something new" is determined by the arguments the
programmer passes to exec. Thus, if we pass "/bin/sh",the location of the
default shell, then exec will try to transform the current process into a
shell. Shells are great because they provide a convenient and powerful
interface to the compromised machine. In other circumstances we may want our
shellcode to do different or additional things.

We have to understand the **calling convention** for system calls when writing
shell code. On 32-bit x86 linux, this convention requires the arguments to be
placed in registers followed by the use of the `int 0x80` trap instruction.
For information on syscall arguments, check out the following
[x86](http://faculty.nps.edu/cseagle/assembly/sys_call.html) and
[x86-64](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/) reference guides.

**Note:** when a programmer uses `execve` in a C program, they are actually
using a wrapper in the C library to invoke the `sys_execve` **system call**.
In other words, the programmer invokes the library function which in turn
invokes the system call. In our shellcode, we are going to call `exec`
directly rather than use the library call.

#### Shellcode and "Smashing the Stack"

Let's take a look at the final shellcode given in "Smashing the Stack" (shown
in `shellcodeasm2.c`) and determine the purpose of each instruction.

```ASM
jmp 0x1f
popl %esi
movl %esi, 0x8(%esi)
xorl %eax,%eax
movb %eax, 0x7(%esi)
movl %eax, 0xc(%esi)
movb $0xb,%al
movl %esi,%ebx
leal 0x8(%esi),%ecx
leal 0xc(%esi),%edx
int $0x80
xorl %ebx,%ebx
movl %ebx,%eax
inc %eax
int $0x80
call -0x24
.string \"/bin/sh\"
```

The ultimate goal is to execute the execve system call with the appropriate
arguments. Thus, the code must set up the appropriate arguments before
eventually executing the trap instruction, `int $0x80`. Of course there are a
few complications:

- One of the arguments must be the address of the "/bin/sh" string, but we
  cannot hardcode the address because we do not know what that address will be
  at runtime.
- We have to use null bytes in our arguments, but we can't include null bytes
  in our shellcode as many functions that read from stdin (our infection
  vector) will stop after reading a null byte. Similarly, the instructions cannot
  contain null bytes either.

Let's breakdown the individual instructions.

- `jmp 0x1f`: Jump to the call instruction at the end. This jump is
  _relative_, which is useful because we don't know the absolute address of
  the shellcode.
- `call -0x24`: We use this instruction to place the address of the `/bin/sh`
  string on the stack. How? The `call` instruction will push the address of
  the next instruction to be executed on to the stack before branching, in this
  case that would be the address of the "/bin/sh" string. It might help to think
  of that string as masquerading as an instruction.
- `.string \"/bin/sh\"`: this is just the raw bytes for the "/bin/sh" string.
  Fun fact: if we branched here, the CPU would try to execute these bytes as
  if they were an instruction.
- `popl %esi`: The call instruction transfers control to here. This
  instruction loads the address of the `/bin/sh` string into `%esi`.
- `movl %esi, 0x8(%esi)`: exec requires an array of argument strings. We are
  going to start setting up that argument array with the address of the
  /bin/sh string as the first element in that array. The `0x8(%esi)` operand
  refers to: the address in `esi` plus 8 bytes. We put this array at eight bytes
  past the address of the "/bin/sh" string because we need seven bytes for the
  string and one byte for the null terminator (which we are about to add).
- `xorl %eax,%eax`: Here we make eax zero so we can use this register for null
  bytes later. We need to include a null word (4 null bytes) in our argument
  array, but we can't store null bytes in our shellcode. Why? Because many
  vulnerable functions, e.g., gets() stop reading strings as soon a null byte is
  encountered. In other words, we wouldn't be able to load our entire shellcode
  payload if it contained any null bytes.
- `movb %eax, 0x7(%esi)`: Move a single null byte to act as a null terminator
  for our "/bin/sh" string. Notice the `b` suffix on `movb`. At this point,
  the first argument of our argument array is set up.
- `movl %eax, 0xc(%esi)`: Our knowledge of execve (read the MAN page) tells us
  that the last element of the argument array must be a null pointer, so we
  take care of that with this instruction.
- `movb $0xb,%al`: By convention, register `eax` holds the index in the
  syscall table of the desired syscall. This let's the hardware/OS know which
  syscall to execute. Why do we use a `movb` instruction here instead of `movl
$0xb, %eax`? Answer: the latter instruction includes a 0x0 byte.
- `movl %esi,%ebx`: Register `ebx` holds the first argument to the syscall,
  i.e., the address of the "/bin/sh" string.
- `leal 0x8(%esi),%ecx`: `ecx` holds the second The second argument, i.e., the
  address of the argument array. Recall that the argument array includes:
  element 1: address of the "/bin/sh" string; element 2: a null pointer.
- `leal 0xc(%esi),%edx`: The third argument to the syscall is NULL (because we
  don't need it here) and stored in `edx`. Rather than add another null byte
  to the stack, we will just reuse the second element of the argument
  array.
- `int $0x80`: This instruction traps into kernel mode, i.e., it
  causes the hardware to transfer control to the OS, which then executes the
  system call.
- `xorl %ebx,%ebx ... int $0x80`: These instructs set up the arguments for the
  exit syscall. Note: this code will only execute if exec fails.

We can visualize the memory layout as follows.

```
View of Memory

        esi+0x7
           |
           |
esi+0x0    |   esi+0x0C
   |       |      |
   v       v      v
   |/bin/sh|0|ADDR|NULL|
             ^
             |
          esi+0x08

```

#### Self-modifying Code??

"Smashing the Stack" makes a strange comment about the code "self-modifying".
This statement is misleading because the shellcode itself isn't modified, just
the bytes immediately after that shellcode in memory. This isn't an issue when
the shellcode is on the stack---as it will be when we perform the attack.

However, when are testing the shellcode using the `___asm___` capability (as
shown in the paper), the shellcode will be put into the same region of memory
as other code and the "memory" modified by the shellcode will fall in the page
as the shellcode. Because of paging---specifically, all memory in the same
page has the same permissions---this memory will also be marked as read-only.

### Testing your Shellcode

The code given in "Smashing the Stack" for testing the shell code is a bit
ugly. Here's what they do (which involves overwriting the saved return address
on the stack:

```C
char shellcode[] =
  "\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b"
  "\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd"
  "\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh";

void main() {
  int *ret;
  ret = (int *)&ret + 2;
  (*ret) = (int)shellcode;
}
```

It is much easier to use a function pointer:

```C
void main() {
  void (*s)() = (void *)shellcode;
  s();
}
```

#### Troubleshooting

**32-bit vs. 64-bit shell code.** Be careful that you don't use 32-bit
shellcode on a 64-bit system. A good indicator is the use of `int 0x80` versus
`syscall`, the former is used primarily on 32-bit systems and the latter is
used in 64-bit systems. Note, you can use `int 0x80` in a 64-bit system but it
can be tricky to make sure that the pointer sizes are only 4 bytes--- pointers
to the stack typically require more than 4 bytes.

**Why does the popped shell exit immediately?** Sometimes when you pop a shell,
it appears like nothing happened even though your shellcode seemed to execute.
This could occur because stdin is closed, causing the shell to exit
immediately. To fix this problem, you either get some fancy shellcode (not
really that fancy) to reopen stdin, or you use the cat trick:

```bash
(python exploit.py; cat) | ./vulnerable_prog
```

**How to check if the stack is executable:** In the EpicTreasure docker image,
you can use `checksec`---look for the string "NX disabled":

```
(ins)$ checksec ./stack4-64
[*] '/root/host-share/stack4-64'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```

If you do not have access to `checksec` you can do the following:

- `objdump -x foo`
- Look in the "Program Header" section of the output.
- Check the permission bits for the stack, e.g., "flags rw-"
- "flags rw-" means the stack is not executable.
- "flags rwx" means the stack is executable.

Alternatively, if you need to check if the **heap is executable**, you have to take
a more roundabout approach:

- run `info proc map` inside of gdb to get the address of the heap
- run the program outside of gdb and suspend it
- get the pid of the suspended process using `ps -a`
- get the memory map of the process using `pmap PID`
- match the addresses (assuming no aslr), the heap might be labeled `anon` in
  `pmap`.

**Debugging tips:**

- Use the `int3` instruction to debug shellcode. It's simple to use, just throw
  in the opcode 0xCC. The following is a good starter: `print '\x90'*100 + '\xCC'*4`.
- If you are getting an `errno` of `-38` (i.e., function not implemented) then
  make sure that you have the right argument in `rax` when you issue the
  `syscall`.
- The return value of a system call will be placed in the `rax` register. If
  the return is negative, an error occurred; subtract the return value from
  zero and look up the number with `errno -l`.

### Summary

Shellcoding represents the "payload" phase of memory corruption exploits. After establishing control flow hijacking through techniques like [buffer overflows](../2099-01-01-basics_bufferoverflows.md), shellcode provides the attacker-supplied functionality that gets executed. While [return-to-libc attacks](../2099-01-05-basics_codereuse.md) reuse existing code, shellcoding involves injecting custom machine code directly into the program's memory.

Shellcode development typically requires:

1. Writing assembly instructions to perform desired operations (often system calls)
2. Converting these instructions to raw bytes that avoid problematic values (like null bytes)
3. Injecting these bytes into memory through a vulnerability
4. Redirecting execution to this memory location

The [Pwntools library](../2099-01-04-pwntools.md) greatly simplifies this process with its shellcraft module. When developing shellcode exploits, you'll often encounter environment-specific challenges that require techniques like NOP sleds to increase reliability.
