Our introduction to stack smashing focused primarily on 32-bit binaries;
however, what you've learned so far will also apply to 64-bit binaries with a
few key differences. Let's summarize a few of the differences seen in the
64-bit version of the code show below.

- the location of the code region is much different
- the pointer sizes are different.
- the arguments to main are passed via registers (`rdi` and `rsi`) and then
  saved to the stack (inside of main).
- there is a canary in place and it uses a segment register

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];

  gets(buffer);
}
```

Once compiled, this C code will produce assembly similar to the following:

```asm
   0x0000000000400596 <+0>:     push   rbp
   0x0000000000400597 <+1>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040059a <+4>:     sub    rsp,0x60
   0x000000000040059e <+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x54],edi
   0x00000000004005a1 <+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60],rsi
   0x00000000004005a5 <+15>:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR fs:0x28
   0x00000000004005ae <+24>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],rax
   0x00000000004005b2 <+28>:    xor    eax,eax
   0x00000000004005b4 <+30>:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x50]
   0x00000000004005b8 <+34>:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x00000000004005bb <+37>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x00000000004005c0 <+42>:    call   0x400480 <gets@plt>
   0x00000000004005c5 <+47>:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x00000000004005ca <+52>:    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x00000000004005ce <+56>:    xor    rdx,QWORD PTR fs:0x28
   0x00000000004005d7 <+65>:    je     0x4005de <main+72>
   0x00000000004005d9 <+67>:    call   0x400460 <__stack_chk_fail@plt>
   0x00000000004005de <+72>:    leave
   0x00000000004005df <+73>:    ret
```

### x86-64 Register Conventions

Below is a table of naming and usage conventions for the general purpose
registers in the x86-64 architecture. The first row is the number of bits
specified by the particular register label.

```
64      32      16    8
rax     eax     ax    al     return value
rbx     ebx     bx    bl     callee saved
rcx     ecx     cx    cl     4th argument
rdx     edx     dx    dl     3rd argument
rsi     esi     si    sil    2nd argument
rdi     edi     di    dil    1st argument
rbp     ebp     bp    bpl    callee saved
rsp     esp     sp    spl    stack pointer
r8      r8d     r8w   r8b    5th argument
r9      r9d     r9w   r9b    6th argument
r10     r10d    r10w  r10b   caller saved
r11     r11d    r11w  r11b   caller saved
r12     r12d    r12w  r12b   callee saved
r13     r13d    r13w  r13b   callee saved
r14     r14d    r14w  r14b   callee saved
r15     r15d    r15w  r15b   callee saved
```

For example, the label `al` refers to the first 8 bits of the `rax` register.

**Note:** Instructions that generate 1- or 2-byte values leave the higher order
bytes of a register unchanged. Instructions that generate 4-byte values zero
out the upper bytes of that register.

### Calling Conventions in 64-bit Systems

The calling convention for 64-bit systems differs significantly from 32-bit systems. The most important differences are:

1. **Arguments Passing**: The first six arguments are passed via registers:

   - RDI: 1st argument
   - RSI: 2nd argument
   - RDX: 3rd argument
   - RCX: 4th argument
   - R8: 5th argument
   - R9: 6th argument

   Only after these registers are exhausted will arguments be passed on the stack.

2. **Stack Alignment**: The System V AMD64 ABI requires the stack pointer (RSP) to be 16-byte aligned at the point of a function call. After the `call` instruction (which pushes the 8-byte return address), the stack pointer will be at an address that is 16-byte aligned plus 8.

### Return-to-libc and ROP in 64-bit Systems

When performing a return-to-libc attack on a 64-bit system, we must:

1. Set up the arguments in the appropriate registers
2. Ensure proper stack alignment (16-byte aligned + 8)
3. Return to the desired function (e.g., `system()`)

Since we typically cannot directly modify register values, we use Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) to achieve this. ROP involves chaining together small code sequences ("gadgets") that end with a `ret` instruction.

For example, to call `system("/bin/sh")`, we would need:

- A `pop rdi; ret` gadget to load the address of "/bin/sh" into RDI
- Potentially a `ret` gadget to ensure proper stack alignment
- The address of the `system()` function

The resulting ROP chain might look like:

```
[address of "pop rdi; ret"] [address of "/bin/sh"] [address of "ret"] [address of system()] [dummy return address]
```

If the stack is not properly aligned when calling a function, the program might crash when executing instructions that require alignment (like `movaps`). You can check alignment by examining the value of RSP at a breakpoint - if (RSP & 0xf) equals 8, the alignment is correct.
