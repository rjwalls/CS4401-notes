### Instructor's Description

This course dives into both basic and advanced topics in software and systems security. It’s designed to be challenging but also very rewarding. The heart of the course is a capture-the-flag-style challenge system. In each lecture, we’ll introduce a new software security topic, followed by the release of challenge binaries. These binaries are designed to test your ability to identify and exploit software vulnerabilities. If you’ve participated in capture-the-flag competitions before, this format will feel familiar.

### Recommended Background

Binary exploitation can be tricky, so it's important to have a solid understanding of how code is executed. My goal is to equip you with the tools and techniques to understand, exploit, and protect binaries. However, I do expect you to have a certain level of baseline knowledge coming into the course. Below are some topics you should be comfortable with before starting.

The content of this course builds upon the foundation laid down in
undergraduate CS courses such as  *CS2303: Systems Programming Concepts*,
*CS2011: Machine Organization and Assembly Language*, and *CS3013: Operating
Systems*. It is expected that you already have a working knowledge of the
following tools and topics:

 - The basics of systems programming, including the C programming language,
   pointers, variable representations, and endianness.
 - The memory layout of C Programs, including the mechanics and purpose of the
   stack, heap, and code sections. 
 - The x86/x64 instruction set architecture, including the ability to read and
   understand assembly language.
 - The fundamentals of operating systems, including system calls, virtual memory,
  threading, and permissions.
 - Familiarity with tools such as Bash and GDB.

I strongly recommend reviewing these topics---especially C programming and assembly---during the first week of class, as they are **crucial** for completing the coursework.

## Course Policies and Procedures

Below are the official policies and procedures for this course. Please take a moment to review them, and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

### Ethical Hacking Agreement

All students are required to sign the [ethical hacking agreement](https://cerebro.cs.wpi.edu/ethical_hacking/index.php) to confirm that they will use the skills and knowledge gained in this course in an ethical and legal manner.

### Official Communication

Important course communications will be shared through class discussions, emails to your WPI email account, the course Discord, and the course web pages. It's your responsibility to stay updated with the information posted on these channels.

### Textbooks

We won’t be using a traditional textbook for this course. Instead, you’ll need to access the readings through links provided by me.

### Grading and Binary Challenges

Your grades will reflect your understanding of the course material, which you'll primarily demonstrate by completing course _challenges_. These challenges typically involve finding and exploiting a bug in a binary to capture a _flag_. Once you have the flag, you can submit it on the course webpage to earn points for that challenge.

Challenges will cover various _categories_, such as lecture practice, binary exploitation, course participation, and game exploitation. The number of points assigned to each challenge is a rough indicator of its difficulty. Each challenge has a unique flag tailored to you, so the steps needed to solve it might vary depending on your specific instance. You’ll find all the challenges available in the course system.

**Challenge Solving.** To successfully solve each challenge, it's important to engage in lectures, complete the assigned readings and videos, practice using the tools provided, and explore on your own. For example, a challenge might require you to read compiler documentation to understand how factors like buffer size can affect compilation. In some cases, you may need to find this documentation independently.

**Challenge time limits.** As we progress through the course, new challenges will be introduced. To earn points, you’ll need to complete each challenge by the deadline posted in the course system. 

**Extension Requests.** The system does not support granting deadline extensions to individual students. However, if you feel that an extension would significantly improve your learning experience, I am open to considering your request. Approved extensions will apply equally to all students enrolled in the course.

To request an extension, please:
- Attend my in-person office hours to discuss at least one substantive question related to the challenge before requesting the extension. This question should clearly demonstrate that you've actively considered the problem and made a genuine attempt at solving it.
- Present your extension proposal at the beginning of the lecture, explaining how additional time would enhance your understanding of the material. Your proposal must also be seconded by another student enrolled in the course, who must similarly attend office hours and discuss a substantive question before supporting your request. 


**Challenge Unlocking.** Some challenges may have extra requirements before they unlock. For example, certain challenges might only become available after you've earned a specific number of points. Others might unlock on a particular date, or even under more mysterious conditions.

All of these requirements are automatically managed by the course system. Here’s what that means:
- If you can see a challenge and submit a flag, you’re eligible to earn points for it.
- If you can’t see a challenge, it means you haven’t met the criteria to unlock it yet.
- If you can see a challenge but can’t submit a flag, the deadline for that challenge has passed.

**Participation challenges.** There are several ways you can earn points by helping to improve the quality of the course. Before starting any participation challenge, **please reach out to me to confirm that the work you plan to do is enough to earn points.** And as a little bonus for reading this closely, I suggest you make a request to join the Hidden Classroom...(but don't ask me about it!)

**Student challenge submissions.** Once they have unlocked the `stockholm-syndrome` challenge, students are encouraged to submit new challenge binaries.  When submitting a new binary, please include
the source code, solution (e.g., as a python script), recommended point value,
recommended title, a makefile, description of the challenge, list of hints, and
a list of related challenges.  **Please contact me before starting
work on a new challenge.**

**Challenge difficulty.** The challenges are roughly divided into the following
difficulty levels: 

 - **Introductory:** Challenges with a score value between 0 and 75 points
   inclusive. 
 - **Basic:** Challenges with a score value between 76 and 150 points
   inclusive. 
 - **Intermediate:** Challenges with a score value between 151 and 300 points
   inclusive. Intermediate challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 500 points.
 - **Advanced:** Challenges with a score value between 301 and 600 points
   inclusive. Advanced challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 1500 points.
 - **Expert:** Challenges with a score value greater than 600 points. Expert challenges will typically only unlock if you have at least 3000 points.   

**Mandatory challenges.** Some challenges are essential for passing the course and achieving your desired letter grade. These challenges are listed under the mandatory category. A key example is `the-bar`. To successfully complete this challenge, you'll need to have a solid understanding of all the basic binary attacks covered in the course.

**Letter Grades.** Final grades will be based on your understanding of the course material, which you'll demonstrate primarily through the points you earn from solving challenges. Additionally, participation in lecture discussions and office hours is another valuable way to show your understanding. However, it's not just about earning points---I expect you to be able to clearly explain how you solved each challenge for which you received points. While oral exams are one formal opportunity to explain your solutions, I may ask you at any time to walk me through your approach to gauge your understanding. If it’s clear that you haven't mastered the concept behind a challenge, points for that challenge may be removed from your total.

I would expect a student with a C-level understanding to earn around 2500 points, a B-level understanding to earn around 3500 points, and an A-level understanding to earn around 5000 points. Here’s how these levels generally correspond to the challenges completed:

- **C-level:** 2500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. You'd roughly earn this by solving all lecture challenges, `the-bar`, two additional basic challenges, and four intermediate challenges. 
- 
- **B-level:** 3500 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. You'd roughly earn this by solving all lecture challenges, `the-bar`, three or four additional basic challenges, and five or six intermediate challenges. You must also demonstrate a B-level of understanding during the exams.
    
- **A-level:** 5000 points, including a successful solve of all mandatory challenges. This point total is typically earned by solving all lecture challenges, `the-bar`, three or four additional basic challenges, six intermediate challenges, and two advanced challenges. You must also demonstrate a A-level of understanding during the exams.


### Course Webpage

To submit your challenge flags, please use the course infrastructure web frontend, also known as the course webpage. The webpage features a scoreboard where you can track your progress alongside your peers. When setting up your account, make sure to use your WPI username as your _username_. However, feel free to choose a pseudonym for your _display name_ if you prefer. **Don't forget to join the `CS557-2025` classroom on the course webpage to access the challenges!**

### Challenge Writeup

For all non-lecture challenges, you must submit a write up describing the challenge solution. You should also include the source code for your exploitation script. These writeup will be due at the start of the next class after the challenge deadline. These writeups must be typed and of quality appropriate for a graduate student.

### Study Buddies

You have the option to choose a study buddy for the duration of the course. With your study buddy, you’re free to discuss challenge solutions and even help each other debug code. However, please remember you cannot directly share solution scripts or flags with your buddy.

**It's important to note that study buddies are not project partners.** This means you shouldn’t use a divide-and-conquer approach to tackle course challenges. I expect each student to fully understand every challenge for which they submit a flag. You should be able to walk me through your solution and explain it clearly. If a student can’t demonstrate their understanding of a challenge, I may need to remove the points for that challenge—and possibly others as well. For more details, please refer to the section on grading.

Once you’ve chosen your study buddy, please notify the course TA via Discord.

### CS4401 versus CS557

The first two-thirds of CS557, the graduate version of this course, overlaps with CS4401, the undergraduate version. However, CS557 is significantly more rigorous: it includes more difficult challenges, additional assignments, and broader coverage of advanced material beyond the CS4401 content. Because of this overlap, but also the differences in depth and expectations, students cannot count both CS4401 and CS557 toward a BS/MS program of study.

### Attacking the Course Infrastructure

Attacking the course infrastructure is not allowed. If you discover a flaw or potential exploit, please let me know right away, but don’t try to exploit or fix it yourself. Any attempts to attack the system could result in serious consequences, including failing the course and possible involvement of the university or law enforcement.

###  Professionalism

It’s important that we all treat each other and the teaching staff with respect. Healthy disagreements, debates, and constructive criticism are valuable parts of our academic environment. However, please be mindful to avoid demeaning language or personal attacks. Learning to handle conflict professionally and work well with others is a key skill, especially in technical careers, and something we all can practice here.

### Academic Honesty 

Students should take a moment to read and familiarize themselves with [WPI's Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty). Any suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be handled according to WPI policies, which require me to report such cases to the Dean of Students.

**Unless otherwise stated by the instructor, please do not share your solutions with others, whether directly or through public postings, including platforms like GitHub.** This rule applies throughout the course, even after project deadlines have passed. Posting your solutions publicly at any point during the term is considered a violation of WPI's policy against facilitating academic dishonesty.

Additionally, you may not use or refer to any previous versions of course assignments or projects, no matter where they’re posted. If you come across such a posting, please report it to me immediately and avoid using that resource.

We understand that cheating often stems from other challenges you might be facing. If you're struggling to keep up with the work, please don't hesitate to reach out to the course staff. We're here to help and want to see you succeed, so let’s work together to find a solution.

Your work must always be your own. While you're welcome to discuss the course material with others, these discussions should take place during lectures or in the public channels on the course Discord server. You may share small snippets of code for debugging purposes, but if you're ever unsure about what’s allowed, feel free to ask me. Also, keep in mind that helping others cheat is also considered academic dishonesty.

Plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are taken very seriously. Engaging in such behavior could result in failing the course. Investigating plagiarism is an unpleasant experience for everyone involved, so let’s all make sure we’re adhering to the guidelines and maintaining the integrity of our work.

### Academic Accommodations

WPI is dedicated to ensuring that every student has an equal opportunity to succeed. If you have a documented physical, psychological, or learning disability, you might be eligible for reasonable academic accommodations to support your success in this course.

If you need to use accommodations, I encourage you to reach out to the Office of Accessibility Services as soon as possible to ensure everything is set up in a timely manner. You can contact them via email at accessibilityservices@wpi.edu, by phone at (508) 831-4908, or in person at Unity Hall. If you already have approved accommodations, please request your accommodation letters online through the [Office of Accessibility Services Student Portal](https://clockwork.wpi.edu/ClockWork/custom/misc/home.aspx).
