**Item #:** SCP-4051

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-4051 are contained in a secured facility outfitted to resemble a comfortable domestic environment, featuring soft furniture, sunlit perches, laser pointer projection systems, and a looped playlist of 2000s-era internet cat videos. Personnel assigned to SCP-4051 are to engage the entities with gentle, meme-informed conversation and are encouraged to document all instances of cultural mimicry or confusion. Weekly cultural orientation sessions are held, although their effectiveness remains largely symbolic.

**Description:** SCP-4051 is a collective of extraterrestrial beings that closely resemble various iconic internet cat memes, including but not limited to “Lime Cat,” “Grumpy Cat,” and “Nyan Cat.” Each entity exhibits exaggerated feline features paired with accessories or visual traits clearly referencing their Earth meme counterparts. SCP-4051 communicate through a mixture of image macros, distorted human language, and enthusiastic attempts at human social rituals, often with comically misguided results. Despite their peculiar mannerisms, SCP-4051 have repeatedly expressed friendly intentions and a shared desire to “go back to the Mothership of LOLs,” a concept they associate with their homeworld.

**Addendum:** Since initial containment, SCP-4051 have made multiple sincere—if baffling—attempts to enlist Foundation assistance in returning home. Examples include building a “spaceship” out of cardboard boxes labeled “fragile meme energy,” attempting to contact “the High Council of Reddit,” and offering tribute in the form of printed Cheezburger memes. While their exact origin remains unknown, SCP-4051 seem convinced that Earth’s internet once served as a “cosmic meme beacon” that brought them here. Foundation linguists and memeticists are collaborating with SCP-4051 to decode their communications, which are equal parts cat logic, internet slang, and unfiltered enthusiasm.
