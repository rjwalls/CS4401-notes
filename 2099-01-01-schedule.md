Below is a list of all topics and readings for this course. Keep in mind that
the schedule will be filled in and adjusted throughout the semester.  **This
schedule was last updated on April 22, 2020.**


### Course Introduction


#### Mar. 25, Monday (but really Wednesday)

Required reading and watching:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 


Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in CS2011, so hopefully you have a copy lying
around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd recommend reviewing
Chapter 3 to start.    

**Released challenges:**
 - All of the participation challenges (Deadline: May 11)


### Introduction to Memory Errors: Buffer Overflows

### Understanding Binary Execution and Code Injection Attacks 


#### Mar. 30, Monday.

Required material:
 - [Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit][smashing] by Aleph One. Read until the

   follow up to the previous video that introduces some tools that are useful
for reverse engineering. Note, Radare2 (covered in the video) is a daunting
tool to learn and [Ghidra][ghidra] might be a better place to start.  

 Optional material:
 - [Risky Business Podcast #576][risky]. Risky.biz is a great podcast for

#### Apr. 16, Thursday

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Format String Vulnerabilities][notes_format] 
 - LiveOverflow's ["A simple Format String exploit
   example"][liveoverflow_format1]. This is an excellent introductory video on
this topic. Much of the content of that video overlaps with the assigned
written notes, so pick the medium  you prefer and only watch (or read) one.
 - LiveOverflow's ["Format String Exploit and overwrite the Global Offset
   Table"][liveoverflow_format2]. This video introduces some tricks that are
useful for making the format string vuln. more practical to exploit. 

Optional Material:
 - ["Format String to dump binary and gain RCE - 33c3ctf ESPR (pwn
   150)"][liveoverflow_format3]. This challenge is more difficult than the
challenges we see in class due to the lack of the binary. Fabian walks though
detecting a print format string vuln, how you can craft your input to verify
ASLR is disabled, and how to deal with null bytes in your input.

**Released challenges:**
 - `format0r-64` with deadline **April 23, 15:00 EDT**
 - `format1r` with deadline **April 23, 15:00 EDT**

#### Apr. 20, Monday

**No class, Patriot's Day!**


#### Apr. 23, Thursday

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: ASLR][notes_aslr]. A quick introduction to the strengths and
   weaknesses of address space layout randomization.
 - [PAX ASLR][pax_aslr]. A bit of history: The original(?) ASLR proposal.
 - [Lecture Notes: Just-in-time Return-oriented Programming][notes_jitrop].
   These notes discuss how to bypass fine-grained ASLR by repeatedly 
leveraging a memory leak to map out the address space and dynamically
constructing the ROP chain.

Optional materials:
 - ["Understanding glibc malloc"][glibc_malloc]. While not directly related to
   security, to take a look at this writeup if you are interesting in learning
more about malloc. 
 - ["Heap Spraying Demystified"][heap_spraying]. This in-depth article
   introduces a technique used for  increasing the  chances of guessing an
unknown address by spraying the heap with the addresses of useful gadgets (`pop
rdi` for instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode.


**Released challenges:**
- `the-bar` with deadline **May 11, 15:00 EDT.** **This challenge must be
   solved in order to pass the course!**
