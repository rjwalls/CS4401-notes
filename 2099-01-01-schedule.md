Below is a list of topics and lecture materials for this course. The schedule
below should be considered a rough outline of what we will cover in the course.
It will be adjusted throughout the semester. The schedule was last updated on
**November 14, 2022.**

### Topic: Introduction and Basic Buffer Overflows    

**Required materials:** Anything marked as "required" will directly help you
solve challenges and earn points. I expect you to have read all such materials. 
 - [Lecture Notes: Getting
   Started.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/getting_started.html) This
set of notes lists what you should do to prepare for the first lecture. It also
introduces the course infrastructure and describes the recommended setup for
solving challenge binaries. In particular, it describes how to set up a local
container for running binaries, how to connect to the course shell server and
access challenge binaries, and how to submit flags.
 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/syllabus). Make sure to read all
   the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical hacking
agreement!** 
 - [Tips and Tricks for
   CS4401.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKxIn6N-kCi38WxOqNBXhxrZnOE9SVET)
This playlist contains videos recorded by previous students of this course and
rovers what they think that you should know before taking this course.  
 - [Calling
   Conventions](https://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/calling_conventions.html).
This is a topic that will appear repeatedly throughout the course. A firm
understanding is essential to solving many of the course challenges.
 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Buffer
   Overflows.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/basics_bufferoverflows.html)
These notes describe the basic concepts you need to start solving the
`stack0r-64`, `stack1r-64`, and `stack2r-64` lecture challenges.
 
Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:
 - [Quick Notes: GDB
   Cheatsheet.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/gdb.html) GDB is probably
the tool you will use the most in this course. 
 - [Pwntools Documentation][pwn_docs]. Pwntools has a lot of features and the
   docs are where you should start when trying to learn those features. 
 - [GEF documentation.](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/) GEF is a very useful
   extension to GDB that comes preinstalled in the EpicTreasure container. 
 - [Quick Notes: Intel vs. At&t
   syntax.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/intel_v_att.html) You will be
exposed to both Intel and At&t syntax when looking as binary disassembly in
this course, so it is helpful to understand both.
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly.
 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in many undergraduate courses, so hopefully you
have a copy lying around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd
recommend reviewing Chapter 3 to start.    
 - [Understanding environment
   variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html).
If you are new to the concept of environment variables---or just want to brush
up a bit. This will be useful for solving `stack1`.
 - [Understanding back
   ticks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48392/understanding-backtick).
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing Pwntools][notes_pwntools]. Now that you've had
   some practice solving challenges, these notes introduce a useful library
that can help simplify the process.
 - [Risky Business Podcast][risky]. Risky.biz is a great podcast for keeping up
   with the latest security news and interviews.


**Released challenges:**
 - Lecture Sequence: `stack0r-64`, `stack1r-64`, `stack2r-64`, `stack3r-64`. Challenges in this sequence unlock in order, e.g., you must solve `stack0r-64` to unlock `stack1r-64`. All challenges in this sequence have the same due date, which can be found on the infrastructure.
 - Sequence: `pokemon` introductory level,`pokemon-rematch` intermediate level
 - `michael-scott`, participation

### Topic: Code Injection 

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Memory Permissions, Register Spilling, and Other
Important Concepts.][notes_understanding_smashing]. Here I introduce (and
review) other concepts that are useful for understanding buffer overflows. Read
this before "Smashing the Stack For Fun and Profit." 
 - [Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit][smashing] by Aleph One.  This is a classic article that introduces the
basics of stack operation, calling conventions, and stack smashing. Note: I do
not recommend using the shellcode given in this paper; instead, check out
`shellcraft.i386.sh()` in pwntools.
 - [Lecture Notes: The Basics of Shellcoding][notes_shellcoding]. Read this
   after you've finished the "Stack Smashing" paper.

Optional material:
 - [Searchable Linux Syscall Table for x86_64][syscall_64]. This table is 
   useful when writing shellcode or putting together more advanced ROP chains. 
 - [Linux Syscall Table (32-bit)][syscall_32].
 - [Quick Notes: Introducing 64-bit
   Binaries.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/64bits.html)  These notes
highlight some of the conventions of 64-bit binaries.     
 - [Quick Notes: Help: My Exploit Works in GDB, but not on the
   Server][quick-outsidegdb]
 - [Quick Notes: Printing in Python3.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/quick/python.html) Be careful when trying to use the print function in Python3!
 - [Lecture Notes: Using Corefiles to Build Exploits][notes_core]. This video
introduces several techniques that will make exploit generation much less
cumbersome.
 - [Lecture Notes: Pwntools and SSH][notes_pwntools_ssh]. Of course, pwntools
   offers an interface for working with a remote server over ssh.      
 

**Released challenges:**
 - Lecture Sequence: `stack4r-64`, `stack4r`
 - `stack4r-revenge` intermediate level

### Topic: Code Reuse Attacks 

Required material:
  - ["Lecture Notes: Basics of Code Reuse"][notes_code_reuse]. These notes
    introduce the basic techniques for reusing code already in the binary for
exploitation.  
 - [A Beginner's Guide to ROP][ropemporium]. Pay special attention to the
   common pitfalls section.
 - ["The one-gadget in glibc."][onegadget] This article discusses the process
   of finding "one-gadgets", i.e., a single gadget that, by itself, can launch
a shell.

 Optional material:
 - [Ghidra][ghidra] is an excellent tool for reverse-engineering binaries. It
   features a decompiler, which will attempt to turn the compiled code
back into C-like source code. 
 - [Reversing and Cracking a first simple program][liveoverflow05]. This video
   covers the basics of reverse engineering a disassembled binary, including
how to visualize the control flow of a program (with pen and paper!).

 - [Lecture Notes: Basics of Format String Vulnerabilities][notes_format] 
 - [Lecture Notes: Stack Canaries][notes_canaries]
 - [Lecture Notes: Global Offset Table][notes_got]. While our focus has been on
   manipulating stack-based code pointers, the global offset table is often a
great target if you have a write-what-where vulnerability.
 - [GOT and PLT for Pwning][got_pwning]. Like my notes on the topic, but better. 
 - [Lecture Notes: ASLR][notes_aslr]. A quick introduction to the strengths and
   weaknesses of address space layout randomization.

[comment]: <> (dont-be-illiterate released) 


### Topic: Heap Exploitation 

Required material:
 - [Lecture Notes: Other Memory Errors][notes_memory]
 - ["Part 1: Understanding the Glibc Heap Implementation"][az_heap_p1] and
   ["Part 2"][az_heap_p2] This two part series describes the inner workings of
the glibc memory allocator and is useful as a primer for understanding more
complex heap attacks.
 - [Lecture Notes: Exploiting Malloc Unlinking][notes_malloc_unlinking]. 
 - [Tool: One-gadget on Github.][onegadget_tool] Here's the link to the tool
   for finding one-gadgets.

Optional Material:
  - The [glibc source code](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/) can be useful for
    understanding the glibc memory allocator, especially when trying to
understand the heap corruption checks. Note: you can use the `dir` command in
gdb to specify the location of these sources. Also, you can determine your
local glibc version using `ldd --version`.
 - [Safe-Linking][safelinking]. This post introduces a technique added to
   glibc's memory allocator to protect singly-linked free lists. 
 - [File Stream Oriented Programming.][filestream] This challenge writeup describes how
   to manipulate glibc file stream structs for fun and profit.
 - ["The Heap: Once Upon a Free."][liveoverflow_dlmalloc1] from Liveoverflow. This video
covers the unlink issue with older versions of `dlmalloc`.  
 - ["The Heap: dlmalloc unlink() exploit."][liveoverflow_dlmalloc2]. This is
   the second of Liveoverflow's videos on unlinking and `dlmalloc`.  
 - OSTEP Chapters 17 ["Free-Space Management"][ostep_17] and 14 ["Memory
   API"][ostep_14]. These chapters from the OSTEP textbook describe the basic
workings of malloc and free. If you took CS3013 with me, you have likely
already seen these chapters.   
 
 
**Released challenges:**
 - Sequence `heap0r-64`, `heap1r-64`, `heap2r-64` `heap2s-64` 
 - Sequence `bon-nie-appetit`, `once-and-for-all`
 - `the-bar` Unlocks after acquiring 1700 points. **This challenge must be
   solved in order to pass the course!**
 - Mandatory Sequence: `b-level`, `a-level`, these challenges unlock once you have reached the appropriate grade threshold. You must solve these challenges to get a B or an A. 
 - Participation challenges `hackerman` and `stockholm-syndrome` unlocked at 3500 points. 

### Topic: Advanced Attacks and Defenses 

Required material: 
 - [Lecture Notes: Just-in-time Return-oriented Programming][notes_jitrop].
   These notes discuss how to bypass fine-grained ASLR by repeatedly 
leveraging a memory leak to map out the address space and dynamically
constructing the ROP chain.  
 - ["Lecture Notes: Side-channel Attacks."][notes_sidechannels]: We don't
   always need to hijack control-flow to exploit a program.   
 - ["Hacking Blind."][hacking_blind] by Bittau et al. This paper shows how to construct a ROP
   attack *without* access to the binary. You should not read every section
of this paper, instead focus on identifying and understanding the key ideas.    
  

Optional materials:
 - [Simple Tools and Techniques for Reversing a Binary][liveoverflow06]. A
   follow up to the previous video that introduces some tools that are useful
for reverse engineering. Note, Radare2 (covered in the video) is a daunting
tool to learn. I recommend using [Ghidra][ghidra] instead. 
 - [Framing Signals---A Return to Portable Shellcode][sigrop]. This paper
   introduces the SigROP technique.
 - ["Heap Spraying Demystified"][heap_spraying]. This in-depth article
   introduces a technique used for  increasing the  chances of guessing an
unknown address by spraying the heap with the addresses of useful gadgets (`pop
rdi` for instance), nop sleds (`0x90`), and some shellcode. 
- ["SoK: Eternal War in Memory"][sok]. This paper provides a nice overview of
    memory corruption attacks (i.e., the focus of the technical portion of
this course) and proposed/implemented defenses against such attacks.
 - ["Efficient software-based fault isolation"][sfi]. Another classic paper that
   discusses techniques for isolating software components even though they are
placed in the same address space.
 - ["Control-Flow Integrity Principles, Implementations, and
   Applications"][cfi]. This seminal paper by Abadi et al. proposes a
lightweight defense for preventing control-flow hijacking.
 - ["Control-Flow Bending: On the Effectiveness of Control-Flow
   Integrity"][cfi_bending]. Turns out that CFI has some important limitations
when implemented without a shadow stack.
- [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.

**Released challenges:**
 - `forking-canaries`, intermediate level
 - `wargames-revolutions`, expert level
