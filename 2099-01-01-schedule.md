Below is a list of all topics and readings for this course. Keep in mind that
the schedule will be filled in and adjusted throughout the semester.  **This
schedule was last updated on April 12, 2020.**


### Course Introduction


#### Mar. 25, Monday (but really Wednesday)

Required reading and watching:

 - [Course Syllabus](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/logistics/syllabus.html). Make
   sure to read all the way through. **Also be sure to sign the linked ethical
hacking agreement!**
 - [Lecture Notes: Old Man Glitch.](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/oldman.html) You don't need to understand all of the specifics of this
   glitch, this is more of a motivating example for the course.  
 - [Lecture Notes: Introducing the Course Infrastructure](http://cs4401.walls.ninja/notes/lecture/intro_infrastructure.html)
 - LiveOverflow's ["How a CPU works and Introduction to
   Assembler"](https://youtu.be/6jSKldt7Eqs). This video provides a quick
refresher in case you are feeling rusty with the basics of assembly. It also
introduces important concepts like *control flow*, the *instruction pointer and
stack pointer registers*, the *push* and *pop* instructions, the *call
instruction*, and the *return instruction*.    
 - [Guide to x86 Assembly][x86asm]. This webpage is an invaluable reference for
   looking up the syntax and semantics of x86 assembly. 


Optional: Other useful (and interesting) references:

 - "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective," Bryant and O'Hallaron. This
   is the same textbook used in CS2011, so hopefully you have a copy lying
around already. This book has lots to offer, but I'd recommend reviewing
Chapter 3 to start.    

**Released challenges:**
 - All of the participation challenges (Deadline: May 11)


### Introduction to Memory Errors: Buffer Overflows

#### Mar. 26, Thursday.

[x86asm]:http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html

Useful for solving stack1:  If you are new to the concept of environment
variables---or just want to brush up a bit---take a look at the following
links:
 - [Understanding environment variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html)
 - [Understanding back ticks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/48392/understanding-backtick)


**Released challenges:**
 - `stack0r-64` with deadline **April 2, 15:00 EDT**.
 - `stack1r-64` with deadline **April 2, 15:00 EDT**.
 - `stack2r-64` with deadline **April 2, 15:00 EDT**.



### Understanding Binary Execution and Code Injection Attacks 


#### Mar. 30, Monday.

Required material:
 - [Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit][smashing] by Aleph One. Read until the
   section on shell coding.  This is a classic article that introduces the
basics of stack operation, calling conventions, and stack smashing. 
 - [Lecture Notes: The Stack and Local Variables][lecture-binexec1]. 
 - [Reversing and Cracking a first simple program][liveoverflow05]. This video
   covers the basics of reverse engineering a disassembled binary, including
how to visualize the control flow of a program (with pen and paper!).
 - [Simple Tools and Techniques for Reversing a Binary][liveoverflow06]. A
   follow up to the previous video that introduces some tools that are useful
for reverse engineering. Note, Radare2 (covered in the video) is a daunting
tool to learn and [Ghidra][ghidra] might be a better place to start.  

 Optional material:
 - [Risky Business Podcast #576][risky]. Risky.biz is a great podcast for
   keeping up with the latest security news and interviews. This episode
an interesting interview about the trust placed in software vendors (e.g., your
AV provider).

**Released challenges:** 
 - `stack3r-64` with deadline **April 6, 15:00 EDT**
 - `heap0r-64` with deadline **April 6, 15:00 EDT**
