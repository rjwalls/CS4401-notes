In this video, I introduce pwntools, a (very) useful python library that
greatly simplifies some of the more vexing tasks of solving challenge binaries
and allows us to focus more on the challenge and less on debugging. Note, the
[pwntools documentation](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) contains lots of
useful examples that demonstrate many other features that I do not cover in
this video.
