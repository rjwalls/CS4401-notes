**(BEGIN TRANSCRIPT)**

**Dr. Mallory:** Please state your designation again, for the record.

**SCP-4051-03 ("Clawde"):** I am Clawde, Supreme Sub-Engineer of the LOLcraft Pawverdrive. Keeper of the Holy Multi-Tools. Clicker of Buttons. Licker of Elbows.

**Dr. Mallory:** …Right. Very well, "Clawde." And you requested this meeting to ask for technical assistance?

**Clawde:** Affirmative, Eldersage. My multi-tools are noncompliant. They have ceased to boop. The boop is essential.

**Dr. Mallory:** I’m not familiar with "boop" in an engineering context.

**Clawde:** It is the sacred touch! The soft poke of activation! Without boop, there is only meowchaos.

**Dr. Mallory:** I see. Could you describe these tools?

**Clawde:** Behold! _(Clawde dramatically produces three items from a Hello Kitty backpack: a spork wrapped in aluminum foil, a cracked Tamagotchi, and what appears to be a TV remote with googly eyes.)_ These are my sacred implements. The Spork of Calibration, the Spirit Egg, and the Zapper-Zoomer. The Zapper-Zoomer used to flash red and summon The Algorithm, but now it only makes "404 noise."

**Dr. Mallory:** That’s… that’s a universal remote. The Tamagotchi is not alive, Clawde. It is a toy.

**Clawde:** _(Gasps.)_ You DARE speak such heresy of Spirit Egg? It guided us through the JPEG Fields and taught us the Way of the Long Cat!

**Dr. Mallory:** _(Mutters into recorder.)_ Subject continues to anthropomorphize obsolete Earth electronics. Likely interpreting technological functions through a memetic lens.

**Clawde:** Eldersage, I do not wish to alarm you, but I believe the ceiling in your lavatory contains a secret passage to the Home Timeline. The sign says "EXIT" and it glows green. I have begun ritual scratching.

**Dr. Mallory:** That's... an emergency exit. Please do not scratch the emergency exit.

**Clawde:** Then help me repair the boop-implements! We must recalibrate the LOLcraft before the cosmic alignment of Caturday!

**Dr. Mallory:** I... I have absolutely no idea what any of that means.

**Clawde:** _(Leans in solemnly.)_ Then the prophecy was true: you are not The One With Thumbs.

**Notes:**  
Dr. Mallory has requested reassignment, citing "deep philosophical incompatibilities with anthropomorphic meme logic." Clawde continues attempting to "boop" various lab equipment, resulting in minor containment disruptions and one singed lab coat. Investigation into the "Zapper-Zoomer" is ongoing, though preliminary scans indicate it is indeed a standard universal remote with feline fur embedded in the battery compartment.
